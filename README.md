This is the technical test I did a while back for Skello. You'll find 2 parts to this test:

- Some technical questions
- A Sinatra app

**Sinatra app**

This a takes a database of posts and comments to create a credible web application listing posts and comments. It was asked that the app must make intelligent use of the components of each post, and overall look like a real web app.

My version has a minimalist backend, a Vanilla JS front-end, which served as a mobile to code some tests with Rspec. 

Sinatra is a simple web framework for Ruby, similar in logic to Rails. It uses [erb](http://www.stuartellis.eu/articles/erb/), and can take routes with parameters.
