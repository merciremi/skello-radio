BACKEND - Programming
These can be done in any language you're comfortable with

1. Give a regular expression that detects hexadecimal numbers in a text.
For example, ‘0x0f4’, ‘0acdadecf822eeff32aca5830e438cb54aa722e3’, ‘8BADF00D’ should be detected.

Not a clue. Typically, this is something I'd ask a teammate about. [I've found a Stackoverflow answer though](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9221362/regular-expression-for-a-hexadecimal-number).

2.Here is the pseudo code of a function that is defined recursively:
-  f(0) = 1;
-  f(1) = 3;
-  f(n)= 3 * f(n-1) - f(n-2);
Provide an implementation for ‘f’. Bonus points for a non recursive implementation.

I've never found someone able to make me understand what a recursive function is and how it can be useful. Also something that would find its way in the Friday pair programming session.

BACKEND - MySQL

1. Write a CREATE TABLE query for a table storing information on users. It will store:
  - id,
  - firstname,
  - lastname,
  - gender,
  - email,
  - created_at

>

CREATE TABLE Users (
  id int,
  firstname string,
  lastname string,
  gender string,
  email string,
  created_at datetime
);

2. Write a query on the previous table that lists the 10 most recently added users.

>

SELECT `id`
FROM `users`
ORDER BY `created_at` DESC
LIMIT 10

1. Describe the color yellow to someone who is blind

> Yellow tastes like ripe peaches, feels like the warmth of June morning sunshine on your eyelids, smells like fresh bread out of the hoven, and sounds like [Mozart's Flute Concerto No. 1 in G major](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ExqsbrOPN4).

3. Describe the data model you’d use for a Battleship game. What are the key objects? How will your code use them?
